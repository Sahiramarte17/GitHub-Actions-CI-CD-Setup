GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup
The GitHub Actions CI/CD setup automates the testing and deployment processes for a full-stack application. It triggers Cypress tests on Pull Requests to the develop branch to ensure code quality before merging. Upon merging to the main branch, it automatically deploys the application to Render, keeping the production environment up-to-date with the latest changes.

 # Features
CI Pipeline: Runs Cypress tests on pull requests to the develop branch.
CD Pipeline: Automatically deploys the app to Render when the develop branch is merged into main.

# Branching Strategy
Develop Branch
All feature branches should be created from develop.
Merge feature branches into develop via pull requests (PRs).
Never merge directly into main.

Main Branch
Once features are merged into develop, the code should be merged into main for deployment.
Only the develop branch should be merged into main to ensure that the latest tested code is deployed.

# CI/CD Workflow
This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

CI: Run Tests on PRs to develop
Trigger: Whenever a pull request is made to the develop branch, GitHub Actions will run Cypress tests to ensure that the code is functioning as expected.
Location of Workflow File: .github/workflows/test.yml

Test Workflow Overview:
Checkout the code.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run the Cypress tests with npm run test:cypress.

# CD: Deploy to Render on Merge to main
Trigger: When the develop branch is merged into main, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the application to Render.
Location of Workflow File: .github/workflows/deploy.yml

Deploy Workflow Overview:
Checkout the code.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Trigger a deployment to Render by making an API call to Render’s deployment API using the curl command.

# Deployment Hook URL
You need to configure Render’s deployment webhook by obtaining your Render Service's Deployment Hook URL.
This URL is then used in the deploy.yml GitHub Actions workflow to trigger the deployment when code is merged into main.

# GitHub Actions Configuration
GitHub Actions are configured in two YAML files located in the .github/workflows/ directory.

# Secrets Configuration
To securely store the Render API key, you need to add it as a secret in your GitHub repository.

Go to Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions in your GitHub repository.
Add a new secret named RENDER_API_KEY with your Render API key.

# Deploy to Render
Render is a platform where the application is automatically deployed when changes are merged into the main branch.

Sign up for Render: If you haven't already, sign up for an account at Render.
Create a Service: Set up a service for your app (e.g., Node.js, Static Web Service, etc.).
Obtain Deployment Hook URL:
After creating your service, find the Deployment Hook URL in the Render dashboard (under the settings for your service).
Configure GitHub Secrets: Store the Render API Key in GitHub Secrets (RENDER_API_KEY).

# Testing
Cypress Tests
The project uses Cypress for end-to-end testing. When you make a pull request to the develop branch, Cypress tests will run automatically.
