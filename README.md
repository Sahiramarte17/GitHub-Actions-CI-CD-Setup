The GitHub Actions CI/CD setup automates the testing and deployment processes for a full-stack application. It triggers Cypress tests on Pull Requests to the develop branch to ensure code quality before merging. Upon merging to the main branch, it automatically deploys the application to Render, keeping the production environment up-to-date with the latest changes.

# Key Features
Automated Testing with Cypress: Cypress tests are run on every Pull Request (PR) to the develop branch to ensure code quality and prevent breaking changes.
Continuous Deployment: Upon merging to the main branch, the application is automatically deployed to Render, keeping the production environment up-to-date with the latest changes.
Workflow Overview
PR to develop: When a PR is created or updated targeting the develop branch, Cypress tests are automatically triggered to check the validity of the code.
Merge to main: Once changes are merged into the main branch, the application is automatically deployed to Render, updating the production environment.
# Setup
Prerequisites
A GitHub repository with the source code of the full-stack application.
A Render account to deploy the application.
GitHub Actions enabled for the repository.
Steps for Setup
1. Configure GitHub Actions
The GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/ci.yml file. The workflow includes:

Cypress Test Job: Runs Cypress tests on Pull Requests to the develop branch.
Deploy Job: Deploys the application to Render when changes are pushed to the main branch.

2. Set Up Cypress
Make sure your project has Cypress installed for testing. You can add it with:

bash
Copy code
npm install cypress --save-dev
Also, configure Cypress by creating a cypress.json file if you don't have it already.

3. Set Up Render for Deployment
Create a service on Render to host your application.
Link your GitHub repository to Render and configure it to deploy from the main branch.
Store the Render API key as a secret in your GitHub repository (under Settings > Secrets), named RENDER_API_KEY.

4. Environment Variables
For Cypress tests and Render deployment, you might need to set up certain environment variables:

CYPRESS_baseUrl: The base URL of your application (for testing purposes).
RENDER_API_KEY: The API key for deploying to Render.
Running the Workflow
Once set up, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically trigger on the following events:

Pull Request to develop: Runs the Cypress tests to validate the code.
Push to main: Automatically deploys the application to Render.
Deploying the Application
The deployment process uses Render's CLI to deploy the latest code to your Render service. Ensure your Render service is set up to deploy from the main branch.

# Notes
Cypress Tests: The test job will run Cypress tests for any changes made in the PR to ensure that the code doesn't break functionality. If tests fail, the PR cannot be merged.
Deployment: After merging the PR into the main branch, the deploy job will trigger, and the app will be deployed to the Render environment automatically.
# Troubleshooting
Cypress Tests Fail: Review the Cypress test logs to understand the failure. You may need to adjust your application or test configuration.
Deployment Fails: Check the deployment logs for errors related to the Render CLI or API key. Ensure that your service is correctly linked to your GitHub repository.
