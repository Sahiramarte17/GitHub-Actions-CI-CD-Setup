The GitHub Actions CI/CD setup automates the testing and deployment processes for a full-stack application. It triggers Cypress tests on Pull Requests to the develop branch to ensure code quality before merging. Upon merging to the main branch, it automatically deploys the application to Render, keeping the production environment up-to-date with the latest changes.
